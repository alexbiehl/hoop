# HOOP - Haskell on Hadoop

These are some experiments I occasionaly have time for. The idea is the following:

    * Let Haskell speak Hadoops RPC
    * Find out what to do to deploy an application on a yarn cluster, from a Haskell perspective
    * Build abstractions over the protocol
    * Build a simple map-reduce framework (of course with nice DSL and such)
